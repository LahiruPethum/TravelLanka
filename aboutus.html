		<p>Our vision is to provide relevant information about 
			most beautiful, ancient destinations in Sri Lanka 
		
		</p><p>
		This is not a guide for the average tourist. We will not show you the best place to buy tacky souvenirs, sell you generic guided tours, or highlight the same old tourist attractions. 

On the Grid features the vibrant neighborhoods around the world where contemporary arts and culture thrive and tolerance is celebrated. It is the quintessential exploration guide made by and for the urban creatives.
