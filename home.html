				<h2>Dalada Maligawa</h2>
				<center><img style = "float : left; margin :8px;" src = "./home/1200px-Zahntempel_Kandy.jpg"/></center>
		<p>The Sri Dalada Maligawa or The Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic is a temple in the city of Kandy in Sri Lanka. 
		It was built within the royal palace complex which houses the tooth relic of the Buddha, a tooth, which is venerated 
		by Buddhists. The relic has played an important role in the local politics since ancient times, it's believed that
		whoever holds the relic holds the governance of the country, which caused the ancient kings to protect it with great 
		effort. Kandy was the capital of the Sinhalese Kings from 1592 to 1815, fortified by the terrain of the mountains and 
		the difficult approach. The city is a world heritage site declared by UNESCO, in part due to the temple.
		Monks of the two chapters of Malwatte and Asgiriya conduct daily ritual worship in the inner chamber of the temple, 
		in annual rotation. They conduct these services three times a day: at dawn, at noon and in the evening.
		On Wednesdays there is a symbolic bathing of the Sacred Relic with an herbal preparation made from scented water and 
		flagrant flowers, called Nanumura Mangallaya. This holy water is believed to contain healing powers and is distributed 
		among those present.The Temple has sustained damage from multiple bombings by terrorists in the past, but has been fully restored each time..</p><p>
		After the parinirvana of Gautama Buddha, the tooth relic was preserved in Kalinga and smuggled to the island by Princess Hemamali and 
		her husband, Prince Dantha on the instructions of her father King Guhasiva.[2] They landed in the island in Lankapattana during the
		reign of Sirimeghavanna of Anuradhapura (301-328) and handed over the tooth relic. The king enshrined it Meghagiri Vihara (present day
		Isurumuniya) in Anuradhapura. Safeguard of the relic was a responsibility of the monarch, therefore over the years the custodianship of 
		relic became to symbolize the right to rule. Therefore, reigning monarchs built the tooth relic temples quite close to their royal residences, 
		as was the case during the times of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, Kingdom of Polonnaruwa, and Kingdom of Dambadeniya. During the era of the Kingdom 
		of Gampola, the relic was housed in Niyamgampaya Vihara. It is reported in the messenger poems such as Hamsa, Gira, and Selalihini that the temple 
		of tooth relic was situated within the city of Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte when the Kingdom of Kotte was established there.</p></br>

		river as evidence of a Buddhist tradition in this country.Most sacred worshipping places of the Buddhists of Sri Lanka since it 
		is a site made hallowed by the visit of Lord Buddha. In the past Kelaniya itself was a large city and the Kelani Raja Maha Viharaya
		was one of the largest and one of the most beautiful temples of Sri Lanka.The spot on which this vihara stands derived its sanctity
		in the Buddhist era 2531, with the third visit of the Buddha to this country.The fact that the Buddha visited the spot on a Wesak day 
		on the invitation of King Maniakkhika is given in the historic epics of Sri Lanka.
		The Naga King, according to these chronicles had invited the Buddha to a repast at this spot which following the expounding of the Dhamma 
		was consecrated and on which the King had built a vehera wherein the Buddha’s hair and the utensils use at the repast together with the seat 
		on which the Buddha sat were buried.However with the advent of time and the destruction of the vihara by the foreign invaders has resulted in
		the original dageba being lost today.Kaleniya Vihara however, received its hallowed status and became a place of Buddhist worship after venerable 
		Mahinda brought the Dhamma to this country.According to the Mahawansa King Devanampiyatissa’s brother Uttiya renovated the vihara for the first
		time. He is also said to have built the first Quaters of the Monks (Sanghawasa) there.

			it was renovated in the early 20th century.[6] The Ruwanveli Seya Restoration Society was founded in 1902 and the final crowning of the stupa 
			took place on 17 June 1940.[6]</p></br>

		forming the shape of a leaf of a "Bo"[1] tree which is the Sinhalese name for sacred fig (Ficus religiosa). "Path" means leaves of a tree and "Ella"
		means waterfall. Virgin forests with a rich biodiversity surround the waterfall.[2][3]Bopath Ella is 30 metres (98 ft) high. It is formed from the 
		Kuru Ganga, which is a tributary of the Kalu Ganga.[1] Its mean rate of flow is 6 square metres (65 sq ft) per second, and its catchment area receives 
		an average rainfall of 5,080 millimetres (200 in) annually. Water from the falls is used for paddy cultivation.[2] Bopath Ella is also the most 
		comprehensively studied waterfall in the country.[4]Bopath Ella is a major tourist attraction in Sri Lanka, since it is not far from the capital, 
		Colombo, and is easily accessible. There have been unsuccessful attempts to use the waterfall to generate hydroelectricity.[3] The path to the waterfall 
		is lined with a number of shops and stalls, and it is somewhat polluted because of this commercialization.

		waterfalls Sera Ella and Bambarakiri Ella. Sera Ella also has some conveniently located rock seats from which a visitor can enjoy the refreshing cold spray of misty droplets.

		close to Nuwara Eliya, and is 2243 m high and a much more exhausting and more challenging climb! The mountain has however three names; Adam`s Peak (this is where Adam first set
		foot on earth after being cast out of heaven), Sri Pada (Buddha`s footprint left by the Buddha as he headed towards paradise) and Samanalakande (Butterfly mountain, where butterflies 
		go to die). We had plans of climbing Big Adam`s Peak, but Espen hurt his knee so we settled for the “little brother” instead.The path up the hill to Little Adam`s Peak is easy to 
		find, and is marked by signs showing the way next to the 98 Acres Resort, to the right of this white Buddah.</p></b>

		<h2>trincomalee</h2>
		<center><img style = "float : right; margin :8px;"src = "./home/trinco-beach-hotel.jpg"/></center>

		<p>One of the finest natural deepwater harbours in the world, located in the eastern seaboard of Sri Lanka approximately 245km from Colombo. There is an account of “Gokanna”, as it was known during the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa period, attracting great sea fares in the calibre Marco Polo and Ptolemy. The empire building British fortified it with fort Fredrick, which stands guard to this day with cannons intact, the approach of the natural harbour the other is the small Dutch fort both stand together. Famous swami rock (lovers leap) is inside the fort where one could dive into the deep water off a cliff next to one of the “Koneswaran” one of the oldest Hindu kovils on the Island. Most of the beaches in the area are wide and the water is crystal clear and one place not to miss is the marble beach, best you use the selections of hotels that will give you a bird’s eye view of the China bay.
About 16 km further north you’ll find yourself in “Nilaweli” beach with the famous Pigeon Island, the corals around the island is a great place to snorkel in our opinion and red rocks lying just 2 km offshore are reachable by small boat. The village of “Kanniyai” holds 07 wells that contain water from moderately warm water to very hot they are famous for their medicinal properties.
In our opinion Trincomalle has everything on offer whether it be a beach stay, diving to a shipwreck, snorkelling in crystal clear water, whale watching across the bay, kite surfing all this in city built on a headland, which naturally protects the massive harbour behind it, also a naval station of Sri Lanka navy</p></br>
