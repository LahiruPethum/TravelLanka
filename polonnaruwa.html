		<h2>Gal Wiharaya</h2>
		<center><img src = "./polon/220px-Gal_Viharaya_02.jpg"/></center>
		<p>Gal Vihara (Sinhala: stone temple) Thervada Buddhist Temple at Polonnaruwa (UNESCO World Heritage Site),Sri Lanka with three Buddha Statues of heroic proportions and a smaller image having a touch of Mahayana Buddhist influence, is the most perfect specimen of Buddha statues hewn out of solid granite in Sri Lanka. According to the Culavamsa, the second part of Mahawamsa, the unparalleled historical chronicle of Sri Lanka, Gal vihara, an archeological wonder of the orient near the Demalamaha seya stupa at Polonnaruwa was constructed by King Parakrambahu the Great (1153-1186 A.C), the supreme builder of the Sinhalese Buddhist Nation. Gal Vihara statues, ambitiously conceived and gloriously perfected according to the Oriental canons, on an abrupt boulder of dark granite about 27 meters in length and 10 meters in height at the centre and sloping towards the ends are still in perfect preservation with their irresistible charm and sublimity.</p>

		<h2>Watada Geya</h2>

		<p style = "float: right;margin-top: -300px;margin-left: 600px;">The Polonnaruwa Vatadage is an ancient structure dating back to the Kingdom of Polonnaruwa of Sri Lanka. It is believed to have been built during the reign of Parakramabahu I to hold the Relic of the tooth of the Buddha or during the reign of Nissanka Malla of Polonnaruwa to hold the alms bowl used by the Buddha. Both these venerated relics would have given the structure a great significance and importance at the time. Located within the ancient city of Polonnaruwa, it is the best preserved example of a vatadage in the country, and has been described as the "ultimate development" of this type of architecture. Abandoned for several centuries, excavation work at the Polonnaruwa Vatadage began in 1903.

Built for the protection of a small stupa, the structure has two stone platforms decorated with elaborate stone carvings. The lower platform is entered through a single entrance facing the north, while the second platform can be accessed through four doorways facing the four cardinal points. The upper platform, surrounded by a brick wall, contains the stupa. Four Buddha statues are seated around it, each facing one of the entrances. Three concentric rows of stone columns had also been positioned here, presumably to support a wooden roof. The entire structure is decorated with stone carvings. Some of the carvings at the Polonnaruwa Vatadage, such as its sandakada pahanas, are considered to be the best examples of such architectural features. Although some archaeologists have suggested that it also had a wooden roof, this theory is disputed by others.</p></br>

		<h2>vijayantha Prasadaya</h2>
		<img style = "float : right; padding :5px;"src = "./polon/4863478767_ba43813a7b_b.jpg"/>
		<p>If you visit the Polonnaruwa Heritage City, this is a never missed attraction on your trip. The Royal Palace of King Parakumba (1153-1186 ) was constructed as seven story building, but now remains only parts of 3 floors.This also known as Veijeyanthi Prasada (or Vijayoth Paya- name refer for Palace of god Sakra). According to the Mahawansa, the construction of this place took around seven years and seven months. Historical records says that this has 1000 rooms, but today you can see only ruins of 55. The building is made up with thick brick walls. Still you can see the remaining two arrays of holes, done on the wall to hold the structure of the wooden floor</p>

		<h2>Prakramabahu statue</h2>
		<img src = "./polon/download.jpg"/></br>
		<p >This beautifully carved statue stands 11½ feet (3.5 meters) in height and carved in to a semi-circular rock. Popular belief is that this is the statue of king Parakramabahu (1153-1186)  thus generally known as the Parakramabahu Statue. . Another belief is that this is a statue of an Indian high priest (probably “Kapila” of “Pulasthi”). The long beard and the mustache, the hair, the clothing, and the body with a slightly large stomach are not what you would expect from a statue of a great king.

Irrespective of who this represent, this is a quite beautiful and unique statue showing the highest level of craftsmanship of the rock carving engineers of that time.


 
This statue can be reached by traveling about 1 ½ kilometres along the Parakrama Samudraya dam. There is a small unidentified and destroyed Chethya closer to this statue. It is believed by some that this is the burial ground of king Parakramabahu and this stupa holds the remains of the king</p>

		<h2>Sathmahal Prasadaya</h2>
		<img style = "float : left; padding :5px;"src = "./polon/DSC_0519.jpg"/>
		
		<p>Sathmahal Prasada in Sri Lanka is a seven storied stepped pyramid located in an elevated area amongst the ancient city Polonnaruwa. The structure has entrances on all four sides and an additional staircase to reach the upper levels. It is believed to be built during the Polonnaruwa era, somewhere between the 11th and 13th century AD. However, no record exists of this pyramid, its builder or purpose.

The Seven Storied Palace is believed to be a stupa by some, due to its proximity to notable Buddhist ruins such as stupas, monasteries and etc. However the architecture is completely different and does not resemble any other ancient architecture in Sri Lanka. It is the only stepped pyramid in Sri Lanka and one of only four other ancient buildings with square bases, the others all being damaged stupas or monastic ruins in Anuradhapura. It is interesting to note that none of the other three buildings show signs of having been pyramids and all seem to have been squat in structure.</p>
